911 Calls Analysis USA üìû

Welcome to the 911 Calls Analysis USA repository! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of emergency 911 calls across the United States using Python and powerful visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. Dive into the data to uncover patterns, trends, and valuable insights that highlight how these critical calls are distributed across different regions and times.

üåü What's Inside?

Data Exploration & Cleaning üßπ
We start by loading and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and contents. This includes:

Latitude & Longitude: Geographical coordinates of each call.
Description & Title: Detailed descriptions and categorized titles of each call.
Timestamp: The exact time when each call was made, providing temporal context.
Township & Address: The location details where the incident occurred.
Features:

Checking data types and identifying missing values.
Extracting and analyzing key features like ZIP codes and townships.
Handling missing data and creating new, relevant columns for deeper insights.
Understanding the Data Through Visualizations üìä
This section is dedicated to visualizing the data to reveal trends and patterns:

Most Common ZIP Codes & Townships: Identifying the most frequent locations for 911 calls.
Unique Call Reasons: Categorizing calls into Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Traffic incidents, and Fire emergencies.
Countplots: Visualizing call frequencies by reason, day of the week, and month.
Time Series Analysis: Exploring how call volumes change over time using line plots.
Heatmaps: Analyzing call density based on time and day to pinpoint peak hours.
Advanced Insights üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Taking the analysis a step further with more complex techniques:

Heatmaps & Clustermaps: Visualizing patterns in call frequencies across different times and days.
Line Plots: Detailed examination of trends in specific types of calls over time.
Correlation Analysis: Understanding relationships between different factors in the context of emergency calls.
Feel free to explore the code, run the analyses, and uncover insights from this rich dataset. Contributions and suggestions for further analysis are always welcome!
