911 Calls Analysis USA üìû

Welcome to the 911 Calls Analysis USA repository! This project dives deep into the fascinating world of emergency 911 calls across the United States. Using Python and powerful data visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib, we explore patterns, trends, and insights from a large dataset of emergency calls. Whether you're a data enthusiast or a budding data scientist, this project offers valuable insights into how data can be used to understand critical societal functions.

üåü What's Inside?

Data Exploration & Cleaning üßπ
We begin by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents. The dataset includes key information such as:

-Latitude & Longitude: Geographical data points.

-Description & Title: Detailed descriptions and categorized titles of each call.

-Timestamp: When the call was made, providing crucial temporal insights.

-Township & Address: Location details where the incident occurred.

Features:

-Checking data types and identifying null values.

-Extracting and analyzing important features like ZIP codes and townships.

-Handling missing data and creating new, relevant columns for analysis.

-Understanding the Data Through Visualizations üìä

This section focuses on creating meaningful visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the 911 call data. Some of the key analyses include:

Features:

-Most Common ZIP Codes & Townships: Identification of the most frequent locations for 911 calls.

-Unique Call Reasons: Categorizing calls into EMS, Traffic, and Fire emergencies.

-Countplots: Visualizing the frequency of calls by reason, day of the week, and month.

-Time Series Analysis: Exploring how call volume changes over time using line plots.

-Heatmaps: Analyzing the density of calls based on time and day, providing a clear view of peak hours.

Advanced Insights üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Going beyond basic visualizations, we delve into more complex analyses to uncover deeper insights:

Features:

-Heatmaps & Clustermaps: Visualizing patterns in call frequencies across different times and days.

-Line Plots: Detailed exploration of trends in specific types of calls over time.

-Correlation Analysis: Understanding how different factors might be related in the context of emergency calls.
